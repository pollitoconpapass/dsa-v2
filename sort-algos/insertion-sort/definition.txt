DEFINITION: Is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. It builds the final sorted 
array one item at a time. 
Efficient for small datasets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms. Time complexity: O(n^2)

WORKING:
1. Pick the next element

2. Compare it with all elements in the sorted sub-list on the left

3. Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the value to be sorted

4. Insert the value

5. Repeat until the list is sorted completely.

(It will make more sense when we implement the algorithm)
