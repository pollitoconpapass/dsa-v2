Sorting Algorithms

DEFINITION: 
Are used to rearrange a given array or list DS elements according to a particular pattern (ascending, descending, etc).
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

WHY DO WE NEED THEM?
1. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms which require input data to be sorted in lists
2. Producing more human readable output.
3. It's easier and faster to locate items in a sorted list.

Types of Sorting Algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
