DEFINITION: Is specifically an in-place comparison sorted. It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists.

WORKING: 
Let's pretend we have this (unsorted) array of numbers:

| 64 | 25 | 12 | 22 | 11 |
 (0)  (1)   (2) (3)  (4)    -> positions

1. Find minimum element and place it at position 0. 
- We create a division between the (now sorted sub array and an unsorted sub array)

       | 11 | 25 | 12 | 22 | 64 |
 SORTED SUB |  UN SORTED SUB ARRAY
   ARRAY    |

2. Find the 2nd minimum element and place it at position 1.
 | 11 | 12 | 25 | 22 | 64 |
SORTED SUB |  UN SORTED SUB ARRAY
  ARRAY    |

3. ... and so on with all the other elements in the list
