DEFINITION: Is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
This is more suitable for smaller datasets. It's known as 'bubble sort' because with every complete iteration the largest elements
bubbles up towards the last place just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface. 
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

WORKING: 
1. Starting with the first element (index=0), compare the current element with the next element of the array.

2. If the current value is greater, swap them.

3. If it is lesser than, move to the next element.

4. Repeat Step 1 until the list is sorted.
