DEFINITION: Is a divide and conquer algorithm. Picks an element as 'pivot' and partitions the given array arround the picked pivot.

There are different versions of performing the quicksort that pick the pivot in different ways:
1. Always pick the first element as 'pivot'
2. Always pick the last element as 'pivot'
3. Pick a random element as 'pivot'
(We will be using opt. 2)

Quick sort is considered as 'in-place'sorting algorithm. It reduces the space complexity and removes the use of the auxiliary 
array that is used in merge sort.

- Is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. 
>> Time complexity: O(n log(n))
>> Space complexity: O(log(n))
