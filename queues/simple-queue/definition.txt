DEFINITION: Linear data structure which operates in a FIFO way. 
- Is an abstract data type with bounded capacity.
- Allows adding and removing elements in a particual order (First in First out)

  
WORKING OF A QUEUE:  
  Front             Rear
=   0  |  1 |  2  |  3   =

* elements are added in the Rear, called Enqueue
* elements are removed in the Front, called Dequeue


STANDARD OPERATIONS
1) enqueue() -> Elements are added from one end (rear)
2) dequeue() -> Elements are removed from the other end (front)
3) isFull() -> Check if the queue is full 
4) isEmpty() -> Check if the queue is empty
5) count() -> Gets the count of total items inside the queue  


APPLICATIONS
- CPU and Disk scheduling
- Handling of interrupts real-time systems. (The interrupts are handled in the same order they arrive)
- Call center phone systems use Queues to hold people calls
- When data is transferred asynchronously between 2 processes, queue is used for synchronization
