Searching Algorithms

DEFINITION: Are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. 
Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into 2 categories:

1. Sequential Search
- In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. 
(Linear Search)

   0   1    2     3    4
| 55 | 62 | 75 | 78 | 11 |

To look for the number 75, it should iterate over the whole array checking each index for the number 75.


2. Interval Search
- These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted-data structures. These types of search
algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search 
structure and divide the search space in half.
(Binary Search)


| 11 | 55 | 62 | 75 | 78 |

To look for 75, it will divide the array in two looking for the segment containing the number 75.
