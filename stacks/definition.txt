DEFINITION: Linear data structure which operates in a LIFO pattern. 
- Its an abstract data type with a bounded (predefined capacity)
- You can add and remove elements in a particual order: (Last in first out)


WORKING OF A STACK:
Computer Memory
 | 1000    | 1002 |
1|         |      |
2|         |      |
3|         |      |
4|         |      |
5|         |      |

If you want to enter numbers from 10 to 14...

5|    14     |
4|    13     |
3|    12     |
2|    11     |
1|    10     |

* The first to enter will be placed at the bottom. And the last to enter, will be placed at the top. 
* Which means, there's only one way of enter and exit. 


STANDARD OPERATIONS:
1) push() -> Place an item onto the stack
2) pop() -> Return the item at the top and remove it
3) isEmpty() -> Tells if the stack is empty or not
4) isfull() -> Tells if the stack is full or not
5) peek() -> Access the item at the i position
6) count() -> Get the number of items in the stack
7) change() -> Change the item at the i position
8) display() -> Display all items in stack


APPLICATIONS OF STACKS:
- Redoundo features at places like editors, photoshop. (ctrl-z)
- Forward and backward features in web browsers
- Tower of Hanoi, Tree Transversals, and many other algorithms
