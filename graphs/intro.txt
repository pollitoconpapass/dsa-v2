DEFINITION: Consists on a set of vertices (nodes) and set of edges (links) which connects nodes.


DIFERENCES WITH TREES:
* Trees:
- Only one path between two nodes
- Has a root node
- Don't have loops
- Have n-1 edges (n: n° of nodes)
- Heriarchical model

* Graphs:
- Multiple paths between two nodes
- Doesn't have a root node
- CAN have loops
- n° of edges not defined
- Network model


DIRECTED v UNDIRECTED GRAPHS:
* Directed: 
- Is a set of nodes connected by paths, with each node having a direction associated with it. Paths are represented by arrows

* Undirected: 
- In an undirected graph the nodes are bidirectional, with no direction associated. Hence, the graph can be transversal in either direction
(The absence of arrows, tells us is an undirected graph)


WEIGHTED v UNWEIGHTED GRAPHS:
* Weighted Graphs:
- Each branch (path) is given a numerical weight

* Unweighted Graphs: 
- All nodes/paths are considered to have the same weight


PROPERTIES
1. Adjacency: 
Two nodes are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge. 

2. Path:
Represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. (Path 2 follow to go from one node to another)

3. Self-Loop:
Is an edge that connects a node to itself.

4. Multi edge:
Two or more edges that are connecting to the same two nodes. (bidirectional)

5. Simple graph:
Graphs without loops or parallel edges.

6. Degree of a node:
The degree of a node is the n° of edges (links) attached on it.

7. Simple path:
A path is a simple path when no vertices (nodes) are repeated.

8. Cycle:
A cycle is the path which has no repeated edges or vertices except the first and the last vertices. (a->b->c->a)


CALCULATE MAXIMUM n° OF EDGES (links) IN A GRAPH SYSTEM
* Directed Graphs
if(V=n){
    0 <= E <= n(n-1)
}

* Undirected Graphs
if(V=n){
    0 <= E <= (n(n-1)) / 2
}

- Where: V = n° of vertices | E = n° of edges
(Only applicable for a Simple Graph, NO multi edges or self loop)
