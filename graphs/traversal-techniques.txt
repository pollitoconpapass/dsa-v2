GRAPH TRAVERSAL TECHNIQUES

DEFINITION: Refers to the process of visiting (checking / updating) each vertex in a graph. 
            Such traversals are classified by the orders in which the vertices are visited. 

ALGORITHMS:
1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
In this traversal algorithm one node is selected and then all the adjacent nodes are visited one by one. 
After completing all of the adjacent nodes, it moves further to check another nodes and checks its adjacent nodes again.

Steps:
1) Define a queue
2) Set start node 
3) Add start node to the queue
4) Print current node
5) Add all neighbours (unvisited, not in queue) of the node to the queue
6) Repeat from step 4 till queue empty


2. Depth First Search (DFS)
In this algorithm one starting node is given, and when an adjacent node is found, it moves to that adjacent node first and try
to traverse in the same manner.

Steps:
1)Define a stack
2) Set current node
3) Add current node to stack
4) Print current node
5) Add any neighbour (unvisited, not in stack) of the node to the stack
6) If current node has all its neighbours already visited, pop it from stack and backtrack to the previous node
7) Check remaining nodes in the stack for any unvisited nodes
8) Repeat till stack is empty
